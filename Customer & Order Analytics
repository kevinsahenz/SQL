# In this SQL, I am querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

# 1. Total orders placed in January
SELECT count(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

# 2. How many of the January orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT count(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales WHERE product="iPhone";

# 3. Customer account numbers for all orders that were placed in February 

SELECT customers.order_id, customers.acctnum FROM customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id=FebSales.orderID
GROUP BY acctnum;
# would use group by so order numbers are not repeated

# 4. What was the cheapest product sold in January, and what was its price?
SELECT product, MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;
# added llimit 10 in separate query to find out whether there were multiple products at the same minimum price

# 5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue, product 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;


#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
