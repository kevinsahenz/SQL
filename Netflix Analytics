# In this SQL code, I am querying a database that is holding Netflix data to answer questions about the data. SQL dialect in this project is PostgreSQL

# 1. Query to find total number of movie titles in the database
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie';

# 2. Query to find most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to database

SELECT max(date(date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";


# 3. Query to list all movies and tv shows in alphabetical order

SELECT title 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title ASC;

# 4. Query to locate director for the movie Bright Star

SELECT director, title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
ON titles.show_id=people.show_id
WHERE titles.title = 'Bright Star';

# 5. Query to locate oldest movie in the database, and the year it was released

SELECT title, release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" 
ORDER BY release_year ASC; 

SELECT release_year, title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" 
WHERE type='Movie'
ORDER BY release_year ASC
LIMIT 5;

# Upong completing previous querey, when the limit was > 1, we can see there were two movies released in 1942

# Query below uses a subquery to find all oldest movies withithout a limit, or the assumption there were only 2 that year

SELECT title, release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" 
WHERE type= 'Movie'
AND release_year <=
(SELECT MIN(release_year)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" 
WHERE type = 'Movie');
